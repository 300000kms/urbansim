Installation
------------

Anaconda
~~~~~~~~

UrbanSim is a Python library that uses a number of packages from the
scientific Python ecosystem.
The easiest way to get your own scientific Python installation is to
install `Anaconda <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index.html>`_,
which contains most of the libraries upon which UrbanSim depends.

~~~~~~~~

UrbanSim can be installed from our
`development repository <https://github.com/synthicity/urbansim>`_
using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_, a Python package manager.
pip is included with Anaconda so you should now be able to open a terminal
and run the following command to install UrbanSim::

    pip install -U https://github.com/synthicity/urbansim/archive/master.zip

This will download urbansim and install the remaining dependencies not
included in Anaconda.

If you need to update UrbanSim run the above command again.
