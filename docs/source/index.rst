UrbanSim
========

UrbanSim is a platform for building statistical models of cities and regions. These models help forecast long-range patterns in real estate development, demographics, and related outcomes, under various policy scenarios.

This ``urbansim``` Python library is a core component. It contains tools for statistical estimation and simulation; domain-specific logic about housing markets, household relocation, and other processes; and frameworks and utilities for assembling a model.
